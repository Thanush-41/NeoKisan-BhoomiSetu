# Authentication Fix & Test Accounts

## Problem Resolved
The issue was that your frontend was using **mock authentication data** instead of connecting to your real backend API. This is why you were seeing "Bob User" - it was hardcoded mock data in the AuthContext.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated AuthContext.tsx
- Removed mock authentication logic
- Added real API calls to backend endpoints
- Implemented proper error handling
- Added token storage and management

### 2. Backend API Integration
- Login now calls: `POST https://agrixchange.onrender.com/api/auth/login`
- Register now calls: `POST https://agrixchange.onrender.com/auth/register`
- Added token storage in localStorage
- Proper error handling for API responses

## Test Accounts Created

### Regular User
- **Phone**: 1234567890
- **Password**: password123
- **Role**: user
- **Name**: Test User

### Farmer
- **Phone**: 9876543210
- **Password**: farmer123
- **Role**: farmer
- **Name**: John Farmer

### Trader
- **Phone**: 5555555555
- **Password**: trader123
- **Role**: trader
- **Name**: Jane Trader

## How to Test

1. **Clear Browser Storage**: 
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Go to Application/Storage tab
   - Clear localStorage to remove any old mock data

2. **Test Login**:
   - Go to Sign In page
   - Use any of the test accounts above
   - You should now see the correct user profile data

3. **Test Registration**:
   - Go to Sign Up page
   - Create a new account
   - Data will be saved to MongoDB database

## Expected Results
- ✅ No more "Bob User" - you'll see real user data
- ✅ Profile page shows correct user information
- ✅ Different roles (farmer/trader/user) work correctly
- ✅ User data persists between sessions
- ✅ Real authentication with your backend database

## Backend Status
- ✅ MongoDB running and connected
- ✅ Authentication endpoints working
- ✅ User accounts created in database
- ✅ Token-based authentication implemented
