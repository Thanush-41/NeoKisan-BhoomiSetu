# React Navigation Warning Fix

## Issue
React was showing warnings about calling `navigate()` during component render:
```
You should call navigate() in a React.useEffect(), not when your component is first rendered.
Cannot update a component (BrowserRouter) while rendering a different component (ProfilePage).
```

## Root Cause
In the ProfilePage component, `navigate('/signin')` was being called directly during the component's render phase when checking if the user was logged in:

```tsx
if (!user) {
  navigate('/signin');  // ❌ Called during render
  return null;
}
```

This violates React's rules because:
1. Navigation causes a state update in the router
2. State updates during render can cause infinite loops
3. It triggers the "Cannot update a component while rendering a different component" warning

## Solution Applied
Moved the navigation call into a `useEffect` hook, which runs after the component has rendered:

**Before:**
```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

export const ProfilePage: React.FC = () => {
  // ... other code ...

  if (!user) {
    navigate('/signin');  // ❌ During render
    return null;
  }
```

**After:**
```tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export const ProfilePage: React.FC = () => {
  // ... other code ...

  // Handle redirect if user is not logged in
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!user) {
      navigate('/signin');  // ✅ In useEffect
    }
  }, [user, navigate]);

  // Early return if no user (while redirect is happening)
  if (!user) {
    return null;
  }
```

## Benefits
- ✅ Eliminates React warnings about navigation during render
- ✅ Follows React best practices for side effects
- ✅ Prevents potential infinite render loops
- ✅ Maintains the same functionality (redirects unauthenticated users)
- ✅ Cleaner component lifecycle management

## Other Components Checked
Verified that other components using `navigate()` are calling it correctly in event handlers rather than during render:
- ✅ AddProductPage: Called in form submission handler
- ✅ SignInPage: Called in authentication handler  
- ✅ SignUpPage: Called in registration handler
- ✅ CartPage: Called in click event handlers

## Status
- ✅ React warnings resolved
- ✅ ProfilePage works correctly
- ✅ Authentication flow maintained
- ✅ Frontend running without console errors
